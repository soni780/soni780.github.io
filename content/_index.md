      title: 'üìö My Research'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        My research focuses on designing and developing novel solid-state materials with tailored properties for real-world applications. I specialize in the synthesis and characterization of functional materials across multiple categories:
        
        **Materials Design & Synthesis**
        - Environmentally friendly pigments inspired by lunar mineralogy, including Cr¬≤‚Å∫-based magenta pigments featured on journal covers
        - Inverse spinel structures with tunable optical properties (M‚ÇÇ‚Çã‚ÇìCo‚ÇìM'O‚ÇÑ) to create sustainable alternatives to carcinogenic cobalt blue pigments
        - Transition metal oxide semiconductors for electronic devices and sensors
        - Precious metal-based normal spinel systems for magnetic and electronic applications
        - Fluorescent chromophores and quantum dots for bioimaging and optoelectronic applications
        
        **Advanced Characterization**
        - Structure solution and refinement using XRD, synchrotron, and neutron diffraction data
        - Determination of cation distribution and site occupancy in complex oxide materials
        - Optical property measurements correlated with structural features
        - Magnetic characterization to probe electronic configurations and interactions
        - Surface and compositional analysis using electron microscopy, spectroscopy, and other techniques
        
        **Applications**
        - Energy-efficient coatings and sustainable pigments for industrial use
        - Electronic and optoelectronic materials for energy conversion technologies
        - Magnetic materials with potential in spintronics and data storage
        - Materials for bioimaging, sensing, and other technological applications
        
        With 10 successful R&D projects and 5 high-impact publications (2 as first author), my work bridges fundamental structure-property relationships with practical materials development for sustainable solutions.
