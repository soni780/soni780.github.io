## About Me

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in Materials Chemistry at Oregon State University, specializing in the design and development of solid-state materials. My research focuses on creating innovative pigments, semiconductors, dielectrics, and thermoelectrics driven by a passion for sustainable solutions and real-world applications.

Throughout my doctoral research, I have led 10 successful projects, authored five high-impact publications (two as first author), and developed novel materials with tailored optical, electronic, and magnetic properties. My work has been recognized in leading journals and featured in several scientific magazines.

Prior to my Ph.D., I completed my BS-MS at IISER Kolkata, where I conducted research on fused bithiophene-based conjugated systems, quantum dots, and fluorophores for applications in optoelectronics and bioimaging.

I bring strong communication and leadership skills to my work, demonstrated through student mentoring, laboratory safety management, and cross-functional collaboration. I've also qualified some of the world's most competitive exams—including IIT-JEE Advanced (2016) and GATE (2021)—reflecting my commitment to continuous learning and technical excellence.

I'm always eager to connect with fellow researchers, explore collaborative opportunities, and apply materials science to solve real-world challenges.
