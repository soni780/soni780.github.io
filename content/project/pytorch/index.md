- Magnetic property measurements to understand electronic configurations
- Optical studies to correlate structure with observed color properties
- Advanced characterization techniques for comprehensive material analysis

### Key Findings:

The research provided valuable insights into how atomic arrangement within the spinel structure influences the optical properties, particularly color. This understanding is crucial for designing new materials with tailored properties for various applications.

### Publication:

Published in Progress in Solid State Chemistry (2024), this work contributes to the fundamental understanding of structure-property relationships in complex oxide materials.
