Understanding color variation with site distribution in inverse spinel structure via neutron diffraction, magnetism, and optical studies.

## Project Overview

This research project investigated the relationship between site distribution and color variation in inverse spinel structures. Different solid solutions M2-xCoxM'O4 (M = Mg/Zn, and M' = Ti/Sn) with inverse spinel structure were synthesized with the goal of understanding color variation with site distribution, as the chromophore Co2+ in these solid solutions can occupy either the tetrahedral or octahedral sites or both depending on the composition.

### Research Goals:

- Establish correlations between cation distribution and optical properties in inverse spinels
- Develop environmentally friendly and cost-effective blue pigments by reducing the amount of carcinogenic cobalt
- Create alternatives to commercially available cobalt blue pigments with similar colors but reduced health risks
- Understand fundamental structure-property relationships in complex oxide materials

### Research Methods:

- Neutron diffraction for precise determination of cation distribution across crystallographic sites
- Magnetic property measurements using MPMS to understand electronic configurations
- Optical studies to correlate structure with observed color properties
- Advanced characterization techniques for comprehensive material analysis
- Structure refinement to solve crystal structures of solid solutions

### Key Findings:

- For Mg2-xCoxTiO4 series, turquoise blue hues were observed for low cobalt content
- Different shades of blue were observed for Mg2-xCoxSnO4 series with a color similar to commercial cobalt blue
- Successfully developed pigments with reduced cobalt content while maintaining desirable color properties
- Established clear structure-property relationships linking site distribution to optical characteristics
