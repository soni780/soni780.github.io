## Project Overview

This research project investigated the relationship between site distribution and color variation in inverse spinel structures. Using neutron diffraction, magnetic measurements, and optical studies, we gained insights into the fundamental structure-property relationships that govern these materials.

### Research Methods:

- Neutron diffraction for precise determination of cation distribution across crystallographic sites
- Magnetic property measurements using MPMS to understand electronic configurations
- Optical studies to correlate structure with observed color properties
- Advanced characterization techniques for comprehensive material analysis
- Structure refinement to solve crystal structures of solid solutions

### Key Findings:

The research provided valuable insights into how atomic arrangement within the spinel structure influences the optical properties, particularly color. By successfully solving over 15 crystal structures of solid solutions using XRD, synchrotron, and neutron diffraction data, we were able to determine atomic occupancies and effectively correlate them with material properties.

### Publication:

Published in Progress in Solid State Chemistry (2024), this work contributes to the fundamental understanding of structure-property relationships in complex oxide materials. The methodologies and findings presented offer valuable tools for materials scientists working on the development of materials with tailored optical properties.
