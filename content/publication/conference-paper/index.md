abstract: Chromophores at different coordinations can give rise to different colors; usually, chromophores at non-centrosymmetric coordinations are preferred for intense pigments. Different solid solutions M2-xCoxM'O4 (M = Mg/Zn, and M' = Ti/Sn) with inverse spinel structure were synthesized with the goal of understanding color variation with site distribution, as the chromophore Co2+ in these solid solutions can occupy either the tetrahedral or octahedral sites or both depending on the composition. Another goal was to develop environmentally friendly and cheap blue pigments by reducing the carcinogenic cobalt to obtain a similar color to that of commercially available cobalt blue. For Mg2-xCoxTiO4 series, turquoise blue hues were observed for low cobalt content, and different shades of blue were observed for Mg2-xCoxSnO4 series with a color similar to cobalt blue. Our findings contribute to the fundamental understanding of structure-property relationships in complex oxide materials and offer pathways for designing new environmentally friendly pigments.

## Research Significance

This publication presents our comprehensive investigation into the relationship between site distribution and color variation in inverse spinel structures. Using a combination of neutron diffraction, magnetic measurements, and optical studies, we have established clear correlations between the atomic arrangements and the resulting optical properties.

### Journal Recognition

Our paper on understanding site occupancies versus color relationships appeared on the front cover of [Progress in Solid State Chemistry](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/progress-in-solid-state-chemistry) Volume 74, June 2024. The paper has already received 2 citations, demonstrating its immediate impact in the field.

### Methodological Approach:

Our research employed multiple complementary techniques:

- Neutron diffraction for precise determination of cation distribution
- Magnetic measurements to probe electronic configurations and interactions
- Optical spectroscopy to characterize color properties and underlying electronic transitions

### Key Contributions:

This work advances the field of solid-state chemistry by:

1. Providing a detailed understanding of how site distribution affects optical properties in inverse spinels
2. Establishing correlations between magnetic behavior and color properties
3. Developing environmentally friendly blue pigments by reducing the amount of carcinogenic cobalt while maintaining similar colors to commercial pigments
4. Offering insights that can be applied to the development of new materials with tailored properties

The findings from this research have significant implications for the design and development of new functional materials with specific optical properties for various technological applications, particularly in environmentally friendly pigments for industrial use.
