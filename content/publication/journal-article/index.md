abstract: In this study, we developed durable and intense magenta pigments featuring Cr2+ in square planar coordination, drawing inspiration from lunar mineralogy. The research demonstrates a novel approach to creating environmentally friendly pigments with exceptional durability and color intensity. Through advanced characterization techniques, we established the structure-property relationships that govern the optical properties of these materials. The pigments show promising applications in various industries including printing, coatings, and artistic materials.
