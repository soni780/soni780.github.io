abstract: This study investigates the magnetic and electronic properties of novel precious metal-based normal spinels including LiRhRu1-xIrxO4, LiFeIr1-xRuxO4, and LiCoIr1-xRuxO4. Through systematic synthesis and characterization, we explore the structure-property relationships in these materials, with particular focus on their magnetic behavior and electronic structure. The substitution effects of ruthenium and iridium on the properties of these spinels are examined in detail, providing insights into the fundamental mechanisms governing their behavior. Our findings contribute to the understanding of complex oxide materials and offer potential pathways for designing new materials with tailored properties for electronic and energy applications.
